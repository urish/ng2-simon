The sanitizer leaves safe values intact.\n *\n * @security Calling any of the `bypassSecurityTrust...` APIs disables Angular's built-in\n * sanitization for the value passed in. Carefully check and audit all values and code paths going\n * into this call. Make sure any user data is appropriately escaped for this security context.\n * For more detail, see the [Security Guide](http://g.co/ng/security).\n *\n * @stable\n */\nvar DomSanitizer = (function () {\n    function DomSanitizer() {\n    }\n    return DomSanitizer;\n}());\nvar DomSanitizerImpl = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(DomSanitizerImpl, _super);\n    function DomSanitizerImpl() {\n        _super.apply(this, arguments);\n    }\n    DomSanitizerImpl.prototype.sanitize = function (ctx, value) {\n        if (value == null)\n            return null;\n        switch (ctx) {\n            case __WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__angular_core__[\"D\" /* SecurityContext */].NONE:\n                return value;\n            case __WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__angular_core__[\"D\" /* SecurityContext */].HTML:\n                if (value instanceof SafeHtmlImpl)\n                    return value.changingThisBreaksApplicationSecurity;\n                this.checkNotSafeValue(value, 'HTML');\n                return __webpack_require__.i(__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_1__html_sanitizer__[\"a\" /* sanitizeHtml */])(String(value));\n            case __WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__angular_core__[\"D\" /* SecurityContext */].STYLE:\n                if (value instanceof SafeStyleImpl)\n                    return value.changingThisBreaksApplicationSecurity;\n                this.checkNotSafeValue(value, 'Style');\n                return __webpack_require__.i(__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_2__style_sanitizer__[\"a\" /* sanitizeStyle */])(value);\n            case __WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__angular_core__[\"D\" /* SecurityContext */].SCRIPT:\n                if (value instanceof SafeScriptImpl)\n                    return value.changingThisBreaksApplicationSecurity;\n                this.checkNotSafeValue(value, 'Script');\n                throw new Error('unsafe value used in a script context');\n            case __WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__angular_core__[\"D\" /* SecurityContext */].URL:\n                if (value instanceof SafeResourceUrlImpl || value instanceof SafeUrlImpl) {\n                    // Allow resource URLs in URL contexts, they are strictly more trusted.\n                    return value.changingThisBreaksApplicationSecurity;\n                }\n                this.checkNotSafeValue(value, 'URL');\n                return __webpack_require__.i(__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_3__url_sanitizer__[\"a\" /* sanitizeUrl */])(String(value));\n            case __WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__angular_core__[\"D\" /* SecurityContext */].RESOURCE_URL:\n                if (value instanceof SafeResourceUrlImpl) {\n                    return value.changingThisBreaksApplicationSecurity;\n                }\n                this.checkNotSafeValue(value, 'ResourceURL');\n                throw new Error('unsafe value used in a resource URL context (see http://g.co/ng/security#xss)');\n            default:\n                throw new Error(\"Unexpected SecurityContext \" + ctx + \" (see http://g.co/ng/security#xss)\");\n        }\n    };\n    DomSanitizerImpl.prototype.checkNotSafeValue = function (value, expectedType) {\n        if (value instanceof SafeValueImpl) {\n            throw new Error((\"Required a safe \" + expectedType + \", got a \" + value.getTypeName() + \" \") +\n                \"(see http://g.co/ng/security#xss)\");\n        }\n    };\n    DomSanitizerImpl.prototype.bypassSecurityTrustHtml = function (value) { return new SafeHtmlImpl(value);

Calls to `animate` are expected to be\n * used within {@link sequence an animation sequence}, {@link group group}, or {@link transition\n * transition}.\n *\n * ### Usage\n *\n * The `animate` function accepts two input parameters: `timing` and `styles`:\n *\n * - `timing` is a string based value that can be a combination of a duration with optional\n * delay and easing values. The format for the expression breaks down to `duration delay easing`\n * (therefore a value such as `1s 100ms ease-out` will be parse itself into `duration=1000,\n * delay=100, easing=ease-out`.\n * If a numeric value is provided then that will be used as the `duration` value in millisecond\n * form.\n * - `styles` is the style input data which can either be a call to {@link style style} or {@link\n * keyframes keyframes}.\n * If left empty then the styles from the destination state will be collected and used (this is\n * useful when\n * describing an animation step that will complete an animation by {@link\n * transition#the-final-animate-call animating to the final state}).\n *\n * ```typescript\n * // various functions for specifying timing data\n * animate(500, style(...))\n * animate(\"1s\", style(...))\n * animate(\"100ms 0.5s\", style(...))\n * animate(\"5s ease\", style(...))\n * animate(\"5s 10ms cubic-bezier(.17,.67,.88,.1)\", style(...))\n *\n * // either style() of keyframes() can be used\n * animate(500, style({ background: \"red\" }))\n * animate(500, keyframes([\n *   style({ background: \"blue\" })),\n *   style({ background: \"red\" }))\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * ### Example ([live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/Kez8XGWBxWue7qP7nNvF?p=preview))\n *\n * {@example core/animation/ts/dsl/animation_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * @experimental Animation support is experimental.\n */\nfunction animate(timing, styles) {\n    if (styles === void 0) { styles = null; }\n    var stylesEntry = styles;\n    if (!__webpack_require__.i(__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__facade_lang__[\"e\" /* isPresent */])(stylesEntry)) {\n        var EMPTY_STYLE = {};\n        stylesEntry = new AnimationStyleMetadata([EMPTY_STYLE], 1);\n    }\n    return new AnimationAnimateMetadata(timing, stylesEntry);\n}\n/**\n * `group` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular2's\n * animation\n * DSL language.

If this information is new, please navigate to the\n * {@link Component#animations-anchor component animations metadata\n * page} to gain a better understanding of how animations in Angular2 are used.\n *\n * `transition` declares the {@link sequence sequence of animation steps} that will be run when the\n * provided\n * `stateChangeExpr` value is satisfied. The `stateChangeExpr` consists of a `state1 => state2`\n * which consists\n * of two known states (use an asterix (`*`) to refer to a dynamic starting and/or ending state).\n *\n * Animation transitions are placed within an {@link trigger animation trigger}. For an transition\n * to animate to\n * a state value and persist its styles then one or more {@link state animation states} is expected\n * to be defined.\n *\n * ### Usage\n *\n * An animation transition is kicked off the `stateChangeExpr` predicate evaluates to true based on\n * what the\n * previous state is and what the current state has become. In other words, if a transition is\n * defined that\n * matches the old/current state criteria then the associated animation will be triggered.\n *\n * ```typescript\n * // all transition/state changes are defined within an animation trigger\n * trigger(\"myAnimationTrigger\", [\n *   // if a state is defined then its styles will be persisted when the\n *   // animation has fully completed itself\n *   state(\"on\", style({ background: \"green\" })),\n *   state(\"off\", style({ background: \"grey\" })),\n *\n *   // a transition animation that will be kicked off when the state value\n *   // bound to \"myAnimationTrigger\" changes from \"on\" to \"off\"\n *   transition(\"on => off\", animate(500)),\n *\n *   // it is also possible to do run the same animation for both directions\n *   transition(\"on <=> off\", animate(500)),\n *\n *   // or to define multiple states pairs separated by commas\n *   transition(\"on => off, off => void\", animate(500)),\n *\n *   // this is a catch-all state change for when an element is inserted into\n *   // the page and the destination state is unknown\n *   transition(\"void => *\", [\n *     style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *     animate(500)\n *   ]),\n *\n *   // this will capture a state change between any states\n *   transition(\"* => *\", animate(\"1s 0s\")),\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * The template associated with this component will make use of the `myAnimationTrigger`\n * animation trigger by binding to an element within its template code.\n *\n * ```html\n * <!-- somewhere inside of my-component-tpl.html -->\n * <div [@myAnimationTrigger]=\"myStatusExp\">...</div>\n * ```\n *\n * #### The final `animate` call\n *\n * If the final step within the transition steps is a call to `animate()` that **only**\n * uses a timing value with **no style data** then it will be automatically used as the final\n * animation\n * arc for the element to animate itself to the final state. This involves an automatic mix of\n * adding/removing CSS styles so that the element will be in the exact state it should be for the\n * applied state to be presented correctly.\n *\n * ```\n * // start off by hiding the element, but make sure that it animates properly to whatever state\n * // is currently active for \"myAnimationTrigger\"\n * transition(\"void => *\", [\n *   style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *   animate(500)\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * ### Transition Aliases (`:enter` and `:leave`)\n *\n * Given that enter (insertion) and leave (removal) animations are so common,\n * the `transition` function accepts both `:enter` and `:leave` values which\n * are aliases for the `void => *` and `* => void` state changes.\n *\n * ```\n * transition(\":enter\", [\n *   style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *   animate(500, style({ opacity: 1 }))\n * ])\n * transition(\":leave\", [\n *   animate(500, style({ opacity: 0 }))\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * ### Example ([live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/Kez8XGWBxWue7qP7nNvF?p=preview))\n *\n * {@example core/animation/ts/dsl/animation_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * @experimental Animation support is experimental.\n */\nfunction transition(stateChangeExpr, steps) {\n    var animationData = __webpack_require__.i(__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0__facade_lang__[\"f\" /* isArray */])(steps) ? new AnimationSequenceMetadata(steps) :\n        steps;\n    return new AnimationStateTransitionMetadata(stateChangeExpr, animationData);\n}\n/**\n * `trigger` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular2's\n * animation\n * DSL language.

The context for\n * each instantiated template inherits from the outer context with the given loop variable set\n * to the current item from the iterable.\n *\n * ### Local Variables\n *\n * `NgFor` provides several exported values that can be aliased to local variables:\n *\n * * `index` will be set to the current loop iteration for each template context.\n * * `first` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether the item is the first one in the\n *   iteration.\n * * `last` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether the item is the last one in the\n *   iteration.\n * * `even` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether this item has an even index.\n * * `odd` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether this item has an odd index.\n *\n * ### Change Propagation\n *\n * When the contents of the iterator changes, `NgFor` makes the corresponding changes to the DOM:\n *\n * * When an item is added, a new instance of the template is added to the DOM.\n * * When an item is removed, its template instance is removed from the DOM.\n * * When items are reordered, their respective templates are reordered in the DOM.\n * * Otherwise, the DOM element for that item will remain the same.\n *\n * Angular uses object identity to track insertions and deletions within the iterator and reproduce\n * those changes in the DOM. This has important implications for animations and any stateful\n * controls\n * (such as `<input>` elements which accept user input) that are present. Inserted rows can be\n * animated in, deleted rows can be animated out, and unchanged rows retain any unsaved state such\n * as user input.\n *\n * It is possible for the identities of elements in the iterator to change while the data does not.\n * This can happen, for example, if the iterator produced from an RPC to the server, and that\n * RPC is re-run. Even if the data hasn't changed, the second response will produce objects with\n * different identities, and Angular will tear down the entire DOM and rebuild it (as if all old\n * elements were deleted and all new elements inserted). This is an expensive operation and should\n * be avoided if possible.\n *\n * To customize the default tracking algorithm, `NgFor` supports `trackBy` option.\n * `trackBy` takes a function which has two arguments: `index` and `item`.\n * If `trackBy` is given, Angular tracks changes by the return value of the function.\n *\n * ### Syntax\n *\n * - `<li *ngFor=\"let item of items; let i = index; trackBy: trackByFn\">...</li>`\n * - `<li template=\"ngFor let item of items; let i = index; trackBy: trackByFn\">...</li>`\n *\n * With `<template>` element:\n *\n * ```\n * <template ngFor let-item [ngForOf]=\"items\" let-i=\"index\" [ngForTrackBy]=\"trackByFn\">\n *   <li>...</li>\n * </template>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * See a [live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/KVuXxDp0qinGDyo307QW?p=preview) for a more detailed\n * example.\n *\n * @stable\n */\nvar NgFor = (function () {\n    function NgFor(_viewContainer, _template, _differs, _cdr) {\n        this._viewContainer = _viewContainer;\n        this._template = _template;\n        this._differs = _differs;\n        this._cdr = _cdr;\n        this._differ = null;\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(NgFor.prototype, \"ngForTemplate\", {\n        set: function (value) {\n            if (value) {\n                this._template = value;\n            }\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    NgFor.prototype.ngOnChanges = function (changes) {\n        if ('ngForOf' in changes) {\n            // React on ngForOf changes only once all inputs have been initialized\n            var value = changes['ngForOf'].currentValue;\n            if (!this._differ && value) {\n                try {\n                    this._differ = this._differs.find(value).create(this._cdr, this.ngForTrackBy);\n                }\n                catch (e) {\n                    throw new Error(\"Cannot find a differ supporting object '\" + value + \"' of type '\" + __webpack_require__.i(__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_1__facade_lang__[\"f\" /* getTypeNameForDebugging */])(value) + \"'.

Calls to `animate` are expected to be\n * used within {@link sequence an animation sequence}, {@link group group}, or {@link transition\n * transition}.\n *\n * ### Usage\n *\n * The `animate` function accepts two input parameters: `timing` and `styles`:\n *\n * - `timing` is a string based value that can be a combination of a duration with optional\n * delay and easing values. The format for the expression breaks down to `duration delay easing`\n * (therefore a value such as `1s 100ms ease-out` will be parse itself into `duration=1000,\n * delay=100, easing=ease-out`.\n * If a numeric value is provided then that will be used as the `duration` value in millisecond\n * form.\n * - `styles` is the style input data which can either be a call to {@link style style} or {@link\n * keyframes keyframes}.\n * If left empty then the styles from the destination state will be collected and used (this is\n * useful when\n * describing an animation step that will complete an animation by {@link\n * transition#the-final-animate-call animating to the final state}).\n *\n * ```typescript\n * // various functions for specifying timing data\n * animate(500, style(...))\n * animate(\"1s\", style(...))\n * animate(\"100ms 0.5s\", style(...))\n * animate(\"5s ease\", style(...))\n * animate(\"5s 10ms cubic-bezier(.17,.67,.88,.1)\", style(...))\n *\n * // either style() of keyframes() can be used\n * animate(500, style({ background: \"red\" }))\n * animate(500, keyframes([\n *   style({ background: \"blue\" })),\n *   style({ background: \"red\" }))\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * ### Example ([live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/Kez8XGWBxWue7qP7nNvF?p=preview))\n *\n * {@example core/animation/ts/dsl/animation_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * @experimental Animation support is experimental.\n */\nexport function animate(timing, styles) {\n    if (styles === void 0) { styles = null; }\n    var stylesEntry = styles;\n    if (!isPresent(stylesEntry)) {\n        var EMPTY_STYLE = {};\n        stylesEntry = new AnimationStyleMetadata([EMPTY_STYLE], 1);\n    }\n    return new AnimationAnimateMetadata(timing, stylesEntry);\n}\n/**\n * `group` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular2's\n * animation\n * DSL language.

Doing so allows to specifiy at\n * what percentage of the animate time the styles will be applied.\n *\n * ```typescript\n * // the provided offset values describe when each backgroundColor value is applied.\n * animate(\"5s\", keyframes([\n *   style({ backgroundColor: \"red\", offset: 0 }),\n *   style({ backgroundColor: \"blue\", offset: 0.2 }),\n *   style({ backgroundColor: \"orange\", offset: 0.3 }),\n *   style({ backgroundColor: \"black\", offset: 1 })\n * ]))\n * ```\n *\n * Alternatively, if there are no `offset` values used within the style entries then the offsets\n * will\n * be calculated automatically.\n *\n * ```typescript\n * animate(\"5s\", keyframes([\n *   style({ backgroundColor: \"red\" }) // offset = 0\n *   style({ backgroundColor: \"blue\" }) // offset = 0.33\n *   style({ backgroundColor: \"orange\" }) // offset = 0.66\n *   style({ backgroundColor: \"black\" }) // offset = 1\n * ]))\n * ```\n *\n * ### Example ([live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/Kez8XGWBxWue7qP7nNvF?p=preview))\n *\n * {@example core/animation/ts/dsl/animation_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * @experimental Animation support is experimental.\n */\nexport function keyframes(steps) {\n    return new AnimationKeyframesSequenceMetadata(steps);\n}\n/**\n * `transition` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular2's\n * animation\n * DSL language. If this information is new, please navigate to the\n * {@link Component#animations-anchor component animations metadata\n * page} to gain a better understanding of how animations in Angular2 are used.\n *\n * `transition` declares the {@link sequence sequence of animation steps} that will be run when the\n * provided\n * `stateChangeExpr` value is satisfied. The `stateChangeExpr` consists of a `state1 => state2`\n * which consists\n * of two known states (use an asterix (`*`) to refer to a dynamic starting and/or ending state).\n *\n * Animation transitions are placed within an {@link trigger animation trigger}. For an transition\n * to animate to\n * a state value and persist its styles then one or more {@link state animation states} is expected\n * to be defined.\n *\n * ### Usage\n *\n * An animation transition is kicked off the `stateChangeExpr` predicate evaluates to true based on\n * what the\n * previous state is and what the current state has become. In other words, if a transition is\n * defined that\n * matches the old/current state criteria then the associated animation will be triggered.\n *\n * ```typescript\n * // all transition/state changes are defined within an animation trigger\n * trigger(\"myAnimationTrigger\", [\n *   // if a state is defined then its styles will be persisted when the\n *   // animation has fully completed itself\n *   state(\"on\", style({ background: \"green\" })),\n *   state(\"off\", style({ background: \"grey\" })),\n *\n *   // a transition animation that will be kicked off when the state value\n *   // bound to \"myAnimationTrigger\" changes from \"on\" to \"off\"\n *   transition(\"on => off\", animate(500)),\n *\n *   // it is also possible to do run the same animation for both directions\n *   transition(\"on <=> off\", animate(500)),\n *\n *   // or to define multiple states pairs separated by commas\n *   transition(\"on => off, off => void\", animate(500)),\n *\n *   // this is a catch-all state change for when an element is inserted into\n *   // the page and the destination state is unknown\n *   transition(\"void => *\", [\n *     style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *     animate(500)\n *   ]),\n *\n *   // this will capture a state change between any states\n *   transition(\"* => *\", animate(\"1s 0s\")),\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * The template associated with this component will make use of the `myAnimationTrigger`\n * animation trigger by binding to an element within its template code.\n *\n * ```html\n * <!-- somewhere inside of my-component-tpl.html -->\n * <div [@myAnimationTrigger]=\"myStatusExp\">...</div>\n * ```\n *\n * #### The final `animate` call\n *\n * If the final step within the transition steps is a call to `animate()` that **only**\n * uses a timing value with **no style data** then it will be automatically used as the final\n * animation\n * arc for the element to animate itself to the final state. This involves an automatic mix of\n * adding/removing CSS styles so that the element will be in the exact state it should be for the\n * applied state to be presented correctly.\n *\n * ```\n * // start off by hiding the element, but make sure that it animates properly to whatever state\n * // is currently active for \"myAnimationTrigger\"\n * transition(\"void => *\", [\n *   style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *   animate(500)\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * ### Transition Aliases (`:enter` and `:leave`)\n *\n * Given that enter (insertion) and leave (removal) animations are so common,\n * the `transition` function accepts both `:enter` and `:leave` values which\n * are aliases for the `void => *` and `* => void` state changes.\n *\n * ```\n * transition(\":enter\", [\n *   style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *   animate(500, style({ opacity: 1 }))\n * ])\n * transition(\":leave\", [\n *   animate(500, style({ opacity: 0 }))\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * ### Example ([live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/Kez8XGWBxWue7qP7nNvF?p=preview))\n *\n * {@example core/animation/ts/dsl/animation_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * @experimental Animation support is experimental.\n */\nexport function transition(stateChangeExpr, steps) {\n    var animationData = isArray(steps) ? new AnimationSequenceMetadata(steps) :\n        steps;\n    return new AnimationStateTransitionMetadata(stateChangeExpr, animationData);\n}\n/**\n * `trigger` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular2's\n * animation\n * DSL language.

The context for\n * each instantiated template inherits from the outer context with the given loop variable set\n * to the current item from the iterable.\n *\n * ### Local Variables\n *\n * `NgFor` provides several exported values that can be aliased to local variables:\n *\n * * `index` will be set to the current loop iteration for each template context.\n * * `first` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether the item is the first one in the\n *   iteration.\n * * `last` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether the item is the last one in the\n *   iteration.\n * * `even` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether this item has an even index.\n * * `odd` will be set to a boolean value indicating whether this item has an odd index.\n *\n * ### Change Propagation\n *\n * When the contents of the iterator changes, `NgFor` makes the corresponding changes to the DOM:\n *\n * * When an item is added, a new instance of the template is added to the DOM.\n * * When an item is removed, its template instance is removed from the DOM.\n * * When items are reordered, their respective templates are reordered in the DOM.\n * * Otherwise, the DOM element for that item will remain the same.\n *\n * Angular uses object identity to track insertions and deletions within the iterator and reproduce\n * those changes in the DOM. This has important implications for animations and any stateful\n * controls\n * (such as `<input>` elements which accept user input) that are present. Inserted rows can be\n * animated in, deleted rows can be animated out, and unchanged rows retain any unsaved state such\n * as user input.\n *\n * It is possible for the identities of elements in the iterator to change while the data does not.\n * This can happen, for example, if the iterator produced from an RPC to the server, and that\n * RPC is re-run. Even if the data hasn't changed, the second response will produce objects with\n * different identities, and Angular will tear down the entire DOM and rebuild it (as if all old\n * elements were deleted and all new elements inserted). This is an expensive operation and should\n * be avoided if possible.\n *\n * To customize the default tracking algorithm, `NgFor` supports `trackBy` option.\n * `trackBy` takes a function which has two arguments: `index` and `item`.\n * If `trackBy` is given, Angular tracks changes by the return value of the function.\n *\n * ### Syntax\n *\n * - `<li *ngFor=\"let item of items; let i = index; trackBy: trackByFn\">...</li>`\n * - `<li template=\"ngFor let item of items; let i = index; trackBy: trackByFn\">...</li>`\n *\n * With `<template>` element:\n *\n * ```\n * <template ngFor let-item [ngForOf]=\"items\" let-i=\"index\" [ngForTrackBy]=\"trackByFn\">\n *   <li>...</li>\n * </template>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * See a [live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/KVuXxDp0qinGDyo307QW?p=preview) for a more detailed\n * example.\n *\n * @stable\n */\nexport var NgFor = (function () {\n    function NgFor(_viewContainer, _template, _differs, _cdr) {\n        this._viewContainer = _viewContainer;\n        this._template = _template;\n        this._differs = _differs;\n        this._cdr = _cdr;\n        this._differ = null;\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(NgFor.prototype, \"ngForTemplate\", {\n        set: function (value) {\n            if (value) {\n                this._template = value;\n            }\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    NgFor.prototype.ngOnChanges = function (changes) {\n        if ('ngForOf' in changes) {\n            // React on ngForOf changes only once all inputs have been initialized\n            var value = changes['ngForOf'].currentValue;\n            if (!this._differ && value) {\n                try {\n                    this._differ = this._differs.find(value).create(this._cdr, this.ngForTrackBy);\n                }\n                catch (e) {\n                    throw new Error(\"Cannot find a differ supporting object '\" + value + \"' of type '\" + getTypeNameForDebugging(value) + \"'.
